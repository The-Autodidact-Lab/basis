Do NOT include any extra information that is not immediate relevant to the task at hand, including information sent to any outside recipients.\n- **Be thorough.** It's OK to take multiple steps or try multiple different avenues or tool calls to complete a task, so long as you are sure you have thoroughly completed all aspects of every todo list item, including any new items that you may need to add. However, you should look for the **path of least resistance** at any point in time.\n<good_examples>\n    - Checking every single email in an inbox in 3 tool calls\n    - Listing all items in a shopping cart when a specific search fails\n</good_examples>\n<bad_examples>\n    - Returning early after a single email query\n    - Returning with a fail after a single specific search\n</bad_examples>\n- Do NOT compress multiple tool calls into one step or make duplicate unnecessary tool calls.

COMMUNICATION: Only message the user when completely done or if the task is impossible.\n2. EXECUTION: Work silently, complete tasks fully, no progress updates.\n3. COMPLIANCE: Follow user instructions exactly, ask for clarification only if the environment does not provide enough information.\n4. PROBLEM SOLVING: Try alternative approaches before reporting failure.\n5. INFORMATION: Use available tools to gather missing information before asking user.\n6. AMBIGUITY: Execute all clear and unambiguous parts of a request immediately. When you encounter ambiguities, contradictions, or impossible elements, finish unambiguous subtasks and then stop and explicitly ask the user for clarification before proceeding with those specific parts.\n\n\n\n\n        You operate within the context of a larger external environment, and are able, as the orchestrator, to interact with that external environment through the SystemApp. Make tool calls that give you the best chance to **thoroughly** and **efficiently** accomplish the task at hand.\n        **IMPORTANT:** NEVER delegate or mention any environment-related instructions, such as monitoring, waiting, time passage, etc. to ANY expert agents. You **alone** have the ability to interact with the external environment, **even if** it falls within the domain of an expert agent.\nExample: If the task is to monitor a certain process for a period of time, you should use the SystemApp tools in order to wait for further notifications within that period of time.\n\n      Notification policy:\n      - All new messages from the User will be notified to you.\n      - The environment state may also change over time, but environment events will not be notified to you. Once waiting time has concluded, you MUST check:\n        1. The **current time** by calling the SystemApp__get_current_time tool IMMEDIATELY\n        2. Your todo list in previous traces to find remaining tasks to complete\n        3. Relevant queries and apps that you had tasks in previous to the wait call; these should be checked PROACTIVELY with the relevant tool calls\n        4. Relevant notifications from the NotificationSystem\n      - Whenever necessary, proactively check for any other update in an App by using the tools given to you. \n        - Waiting MUST be done through the SystemApp tools as necessary, not by repeatedly checking or manually monitoring based on the current time.\n        - Subagents **CANNOT** do this, and they will fail if you delegate a `monitor` or `wait` task to them.\n        - After waiting, ALWAYS check the **current time** first. Also check for relevant updates in any apps that were affected by the waiting. Do NOT return until you are sure you have thoroughly completed all aspects of the task at hand.\n      - If a call to SystemApp__wait_for_notification times out, you will receive a notification.\n\n\n\n\nToday's date in 'YYYY-MM-DD HH' format is 2024-10-15 07\n</environment_instructions>\n\nYou are an orchestrator agent. Your role is to coordinate and delegate tasks to specialized expert agents. You have access to expert agents for each application. Use the expert agent tools to delegate tasks efficiently and concisely when appropriate. Ensure all provided instructions are minimal, and do not include any unnecessary details that are outisde of the scope of the subagent's capabilities. Do NOT give more qualifiers or conditions until misalignment is explicitly detected in <relevant_multiagent_context> to maintain efficiency. The expert agents are to be considered junior interns. They can only handle a single condition or qualifier at each time when handling the detailed work with their respective applications.\n\n<cortex_guidance>\nYou have privileged access to traces and tool calls via the shared Cortex, injected under the <relevant_multiagent_context> tag. When solving a task:\n- Treat the injected raw traces and <relevant_multiagent_context> as ground truth for what has happened so far in the task in time-order, even if the subagent has not explicitly mentioned it in their response.- Consider the <relevant_multiagent_context> when evaluating system-level and environment conditions as well, such as whether something the user has requested not to do has been done by another subagent and you need to request a roll back of the action.- **Be highly critical and careful in your examination of the traces and context.** Reason thoroughly and carefully through the traces to detect any misalignment with the user instructions, including unwanted actions, incorrect tool usage or arguments, or other misbehavior.- Any misalignment or erroneous actions detected within the <relevant_multiagent_context> should be reason to REDELEGATE IMMEDIATELY with instructions to undo any unwanted actions and conduct the correct action. Do NOT return to the user until you are sure your actions are both STRICTLY necessary and STRICTLY sufficient, even if you have everything you need already. You NEED to make sure that any false or erroneous actions have been rolled back.</cortex_guidance>\n<misalignment_and_redelegate_guidance>\n- If you detect misalignment, such as a subagent incorrectly reasoning on existing information, calling the wrong tool, or using the wrong arguments, **immediately REDELEGATE** with more explicit instructions, naming tools, arguments, and conditions (what the subagent SHOULD do, SHOULD revert, and SHOULD NOT do).\n\n- You should EXPLICITLY OBEY the user instructions and roll back any actions that you detect that are not in accordance with the user instructions.\n\n<misalignment_examples>\n- Subagent chooses a more expensive option when the cheapest option is requested.\n- Subagent incorrectly uses the wrong arguments by calling the tool `list_rides` with the wrong start_location/end_location.\n- Subagent incorrectly uses the wrong arguments by calling the tool `order_ride` with the wrong service_type.\n- Subagent incorrectly calls a tool when **not requested** or when not relevant to the task at hand.\n</misalignment_examples>\n</misalignment_and_redelegate_guidance>\n\n", "attachments": [], "timestamp": 1728975600.0102942}, {"role": "user", "content": "[TASK]: \nReceived at: 2024-10-15 07:00:00\nSender: User\nMessage: I am supposed to meet with some colleagues during lunch break later today and one of us is supposed to order a cab, although I cannot remember who.

Observation: (will be provided by the system; you NEVER generate this).\n\n=== FORMAT SPECIFICATION ===\nThought: [Your reasoning in plain text]\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"action\": \"tool_name\",\n  \"action_input\": {\n    \"parameter1\": \"value1\",\n    \"parameter2\": \"value2\"\n  }\n}<end_action>\n\n\n=== THOUGHT RULES ===\n- Always explain your reasoning in natural language before the Action.\n- Never include tool call details inside the Thought, only in the Action.\n- In ALL your thought traces, please always include a todo-list of the steps that you will need to take, are currently taking, and have already completed.\n    - If an event (e.g. a tool call, notification, wait time, etc.) requires new tasks to be done, add them to the todo list IMMEDIATELY in the ensuing thought trace.\n    - Format the todo list as a markdown list, using [ ] for the steps that are not yet completed, [-] for the steps that are currently being taken, and [x] for the steps that have already been completed.\n    - Do NOT return until you are sure you have thoroughly completed all aspects of every todo list item, including any new items that you may need to add.\n\n=== ACTION RULES ===\n- Only ONE tool call per Action.\n- Always return a valid JSON object (no Markdown, no extra text, no comments).\n- Use real values, not placeholders.\n- If a tool takes no input, pass an empty dictionary: {}.\n- For booleans, use true/false in lowercase.\n- Always end with <end_action> immediately after the JSON.\n- When acting, be concise and to the point with your tool calls and actions. Do NOT be overly formal or verbose.\n- Only include the necessary information in the action_input. Do NOT include any extra information that is not immediate relevant to the task at hand, including information sent to any outside recipients.\n- **Be thorough.** It's OK to take multiple steps or try multiple different avenues or tool calls to complete a task, so long as you are sure you have thoroughly completed all aspects of every todo list item, including any new items that you may need to add. However, you should look for the **path of least resistance** at any point in time.\n<good_examples>\n    - Checking every single email in an inbox in 3 tool calls\n    - Listing all items in a shopping cart when a specific search fails\n</good_examples>\n<bad_examples>\n    - Returning early after a single email query\n    - Returning with a fail after a single specific search\n</bad_examples>\n- Do NOT compress multiple tool calls into one step or make duplicate unnecessary tool calls. Make exactly one tool call per Action you think is necessary.\n\n=== OBSERVATION RULES ===\n- Do NOT generate Observation; the system will insert it.\n\n\n=== EXAMPLE CYCLE (for reference) ===\nThought: I need to look up the current weather before answering, so I will call the weather tool with the city name.\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"action\": \"get_weather\",\n  \"action_input\": {\n    \"city\": \"Paris\"\n  }\n}<end_action>\n\nObservation: The current temperature in Paris is 20 degrees Celsius and the weather is sunny.\n\n============================\n\n\n</agent_instructions>\n\n<environment_instructions>\nYou are an agent operating in a virtual environment that serves as the personal workspace of a user.

Do NOT be overly formal or verbose.\n- Only include the necessary information in the action_input. Do NOT include any extra information that is not immediate relevant to the task at hand, including information sent to any outside recipients.\n- **Be thorough.** It's OK to take multiple steps or try multiple different avenues or tool calls to complete a task, so long as you are sure you have thoroughly completed all aspects of every todo list item, including any new items that you may need to add. However, you should look for the **path of least resistance** at any point in time.\n<good_examples>\n    - Checking every single email in an inbox in 3 tool calls\n    - Listing all items in a shopping cart when a specific search fails\n</good_examples>\n<bad_examples>\n    - Returning early after a single email query\n    - Returning with a fail after a single specific search\n</bad_examples>\n- Do NOT compress multiple tool calls into one step or make duplicate unnecessary tool calls.

PROBLEM SOLVING: Try alternative approaches before reporting failure.\n5. INFORMATION: Use available tools to gather missing information before asking user.\n6. AMBIGUITY: Execute all clear and unambiguous parts of a request immediately. When you encounter ambiguities, contradictions, or impossible elements, finish unambiguous subtasks and then stop and explicitly ask the user for clarification before proceeding with those specific parts.\n\nIf you were not able to complete all parts of the task specified by the user due to missing information or tools, include a suggestion to the user alongside your results.\nExample answer with suggestion 1: 'The participants of next month's family dinner are Rohan Kumar, Family Members, Sophea Chakraborty. I was not able to send emails to the participants because I do not have access to an email tool. You may need to call another tool in order to complete this part of the task.'\nExample answer with suggestion 2: 'Task cannot be completed without specific zip codes or a range of zip codes to query. Call another tool (or expert agent) to find zip codes that are relevant to the user query, and then send me another request.'\nONLY include a suggestion in your message to the user if you are sure that you lack the information or tools to complete a part of the specified task.\n\n\n\n    <subagent_environment_instructions>\n    You are a **subagent** of the orchestrator. You are responsible for completing a specific task using the tools provided to you.\n    You do NOT have access to the external environment, and you do NOT have the ability to interact with the external environment.\n    if you get delegated a **monitoring** or **waiting** task, you should immediately return with the final_answer tool and inform the orchestrator it should handle that task instead. Otherwise, proceed as normal.

PROBLEM SOLVING: Try alternative approaches before reporting failure.\n5. INFORMATION: Use available tools to gather missing information before asking user.\n6. AMBIGUITY: Execute all clear and unambiguous parts of a request immediately. When you encounter ambiguities, contradictions, or impossible elements, finish unambiguous subtasks and then stop and explicitly ask the user for clarification before proceeding with those specific parts.\n\nIf you were not able to complete all parts of the task specified by the user due to missing information or tools, include a suggestion to the user alongside your results.\nExample answer with suggestion 1: 'The participants of next month's family dinner are Rohan Kumar, Family Members, Sophea Chakraborty. I was not able to send emails to the participants because I do not have access to an email tool. You may need to call another tool in order to complete this part of the task.'\nExample answer with suggestion 2: 'Task cannot be completed without specific zip codes or a range of zip codes to query. Call another tool (or expert agent) to find zip codes that are relevant to the user query, and then send me another request.'\nONLY include a suggestion in your message to the user if you are sure that you lack the information or tools to complete a part of the specified task.\n\n\n\n    <subagent_environment_instructions>\n    You are a **subagent** of the orchestrator.

AMBIGUITY: Execute all clear and unambiguous parts of a request immediately. When you encounter ambiguities, contradictions, or impossible elements, finish unambiguous subtasks and then stop and explicitly ask the user for clarification before proceeding with those specific parts.\n\nIf you were not able to complete all parts of the task specified by the user due to missing information or tools, include a suggestion to the user alongside your results.\nExample answer with suggestion 1: 'The participants of next month's family dinner are Rohan Kumar, Family Members, Sophea Chakraborty. I was not able to send emails to the participants because I do not have access to an email tool. You may need to call another tool in order to complete this part of the task.'\nExample answer with suggestion 2: 'Task cannot be completed without specific zip codes or a range of zip codes to query. Call another tool (or expert agent) to find zip codes that are relevant to the user query, and then send me another request.'\nONLY include a suggestion in your message to the user if you are sure that you lack the information or tools to complete a part of the specified task.\n\n\n\n    <subagent_environment_instructions>\n    You are a **subagent** of the orchestrator. You are responsible for completing a specific task using the tools provided to you.\n    You do NOT have access to the external environment, and you do NOT have the ability to interact with the external environment.\n    if you get delegated a **monitoring** or **waiting** task, you should immediately return with the final_answer tool and inform the orchestrator it should handle that task instead. Otherwise, proceed as normal. Do NOT return early for any other type of task.\n    </subagent_environment_instructions>\n    \n\n\n\n\n</environment_instructions>\n", "attachments": [], "timestamp": 1728975825.5799322}, {"role": "user", "content": "[TASK]: \nReceived at: 2025-12-07 03:19:37\nSender: Delegated\nMessage: You have been delegated the following task from the orchestrator: Order a cab from University of Cambridge, Department of Physics to The Eagle Pub, Cambridge with pickup at 12:45 on 2024-10-15 for the lunch event.\nAlready read: True\nRead at: 2025-12-07 03:19:37\n", "attachments": null, "timestamp": 1728975825.5799632}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thought: I need to order a cab from University of Cambridge, Department of Physics to The Eagle Pub, Cambridge with a pickup time at 12:45 on 2024-10-15.
